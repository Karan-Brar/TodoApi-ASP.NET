This is a repository that contains code files for a simplistic web API (RESTful) created using ASP.NET Core.

The purpose of this API is to provide endpoints for the users to interact with To-do items.

You can add items like "Get Sara from daycare" to a PostgreSQL database and you can even perform functions like deleting the item or modifying it using the endpoints provided.
